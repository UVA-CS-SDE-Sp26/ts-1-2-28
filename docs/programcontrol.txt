PROGRAM BEHAVIOR DESIGN:
- if the program is run with no arguments, the program should display a list of available files
- if the program is run with one argument (a file number), the program should display
    deciphered text
- if the program is run with two arguments (a file number and key), the program should display
    the text deciphered with the specified key
- if invalid input is provided, the program will display an error message and exit

* ask file handler for a list of available files or ask file handler for the contents of a
specific file (which will be passed to cipher)

TESTS:
- test running the program with no arguments (ex. java topsecret)
- test running the program with a valid number and default key (ex. java topsecret 01)
- test running the program with a valid number and custom key (ex. java topsecret 01 customkey.txt)
- test invalid file numbers (ex. java topsecret 99)
- test missing files (ex. java topsecret abc)
