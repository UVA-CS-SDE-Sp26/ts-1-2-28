to write:
String decipher-method (String data) {run method (char)}
String decipher-method (String data, String key2) {run method (char, key2)}
    takes a string and runs the char decipher-method for every character in the length
        (for loop, string.IndexAt(i))

char decipher-method (char x)
char decipher-method (char x, String key2)
    takes a character, or a character and a text file (in a certain format)
    returns the character deciphered

the character has an index in the key file based on ASCII value ((int) character - 65 +/- 32 ;
    //the key is in opposite order to ASCII) plus 53 (26 + 26 + a new-line).
    do something for numbers... or just string.charAt(key.getIndexOf(char) + (53+ #numbers))

have an Interface (with two String methods)
test all four methods: test string methods by mocking the char methods? definitely mocking the input strings

Do I have to parse the key-file (either of them) into data? no
Do I have a separate function that runs my decryption method on every character in the file? yes

Who is "verifying" the provided key (file handler or here)?
