You are responsible for the command line interface used by the user to run the program.
Create a file, userinterface.txt, in the docs folder to document the user interface. (the command prompt options)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

command prompt options:
 - java topsecret: program should be run from the class "TopSecret" using this command

 - java topsecret: list the number files available to display
 - java topsecret [num]: when it has a number as an argument, the content of the specified file is displayed using default deciphering key
 - java topsecret [num] [.txt file]: when it also has a .txt as a second argument, the content of the specified file is displayed using the alternate deciphering key


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 what this should do:

 - when the program runs with no arguments, it should list the number files available to display:
ex:
        01 filea.txt
        02 fileb.txt
        03 filec.txt

- when the program runs with a number as an argument, the contents of the corresponding file is displayed on screen:
ex:
        java topsecret 01
        (this displays on screen the contents of the file filea.txt)

program exits after showing the file list, the contents of an indicated file, or after displaying an error message


- if no second parameter, program uses the default key for deciphering.

- if there is a second parameter, program uses it to specify an alternate key to use for deciphering
