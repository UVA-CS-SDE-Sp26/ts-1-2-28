String decipher-method (String data, String key) {run method (char, key)}
    takes a string and runs the char decipher-method for every character in the length
        (for loop, string.IndexAt(i)) (ignore spaces and newlines)

char decipher-method (char x, String key)
    takes a character, or a character and a text file converted to String (in a certain format)
    returns the character deciphered

boolean verify-key (String key)
    takes a key String and checks it's in the right format

the character has an index in the key file (key.IndexOf(character) + key.IndexOf(newline))


Do I have to parse the key-file (either of them) into data? no
Do I have a separate function that runs my decryption method on every character in the file? yes

"Verifying" the provided key:
look for the newline, count the index, check the first 10 characters to be uppercase (then check
index 26-36 to be lower case or numbers, if there are enough characters before the newline),
lowercase (check 26-36 to be numbers if they don't run into the newline), or numbers; lowercase
and numbers check for the uppercase and each other up until the newline too (so the default key is
uppercase, lowercase, numbers but the provided keys could be just one of each or have 2 or 3 in
any order). Keys with incomplete lowercase sections (or uppercase, or numbers) have all those
characters ignored when that key is applied (and the decrypt method accounts for that)

test verifying keys (15) with only:
numbers, lower, or upper
numbers and lower, numbers and upper, lower and upper
lower and numbers, upper and numbers, upper and lower
lower, upper, numbers; lower, numbers, upper;
upper, lower, numbers; upper, numbers, lower;
numbers, upper, lower; numbers, lower, upper;
incomplete numbers, incomplete upper, incomplete lower

test decrypts with data strings that include lots of new-lines and spaces
