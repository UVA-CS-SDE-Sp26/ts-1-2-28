String decipher-method (String data, String key) {run method (char, key)}
    takes a string and runs the char decipher-method for every character in the length
        (for loop, string.IndexAt(i)) (ignore spaces, newlines, and other non-valid characters)

char decipher-method (char x, String key)
    takes a character, or a character and a text file converted to String (in a certain format)
    returns the character deciphered (character at the index:
        (key.IndexOf(character) + key.IndexOf(newline)))

boolean verify-key (String key)
    takes a key String and checks it's in the right format


Do I have to parse the key-file (either of them) into data? no-> shouldn't, but apparently
Do I have a separate function that runs my decryption method on every character in the file? yes

"Verifying" the provided key:
look for the newline, save the index, check for valid uppercase, lowercase, and numbers, in all
combinations

test verifying keys (15) with only:
numbers, lower, or upper
numbers and lower, numbers and upper, lower and upper
lower and numbers, upper and numbers, upper and lower;
lower, upper, numbers; lower, numbers, upper;
upper, lower, numbers; upper, numbers, lower;
numbers, upper, lower; numbers, lower, upper;
incomplete numbers, incomplete upper, incomplete lower

test decrypts with data strings that include lots of new-lines and spaces
