String decipher-method (String data, String key2) {run method (char, key2)}
    takes a string and runs the char decipher-method for every character in the length
        (for loop, string.IndexAt(i)) (ignore spaces and newlines)

char decipher-method (char x, String key2)
    takes a character, or a character and a text file (in a certain format)
    returns the character deciphered


the character has an index in the key file based on ASCII value ((int) character - 65 +/- 32 ;
    //the key is in opposite order to ASCII) plus 53 (26 + 26 + a new-line).
    do something for numbers... or just string.charAt(key.getIndexOf(char) + (53+ #numbers))

have an Interface (with two String methods)
test methods: test string methods by mocking the char methods? definitely mocking the input strings.
For the string method: A mock input string is passed into the string function and it calls the mock
char function, which is essentially return an array of characters one at a time
For the char method: A


Do I have to parse the key-file (either of them) into data? no
Do I have a separate function that runs my decryption method on every character in the file? yes

"Verifying" the provided key:
look for the newline, count the index, check the first 10 characters to be uppercase (then check
index 26-36 to be lower case or numbers, if there are enough characters before the newline),
lowercase (check 26-36 to be numbers if they don't run into the newline), or numbers; lowercase
and numbers check for the uppercase and each other up until the newline too (so the default key is
uppercase, lowercase, numbers but the provided keys could be just one of each or have 2 or 3 in
any order). Keys with incomplete lowercase sections (or uppercase, or numbers) have all those
characters ignored when that key is applied (and the decrypt method accounts for that)
