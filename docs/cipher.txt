to write:
char method (char x)
char method (char x, file or string key2.txt)

takes a character, or a character and a text file (in a certain format)
returns the character deciphered

the character has an index in the key file based on ASCII value ((int) character - 65 +/- 32 ;
    //the key is in opposite order to ASCII) plus 53 (26 + 26 + a new-line)


Do I have to parse the key-file (either of them) into data?
Do I have a separate function that runs my decryption method on every character in the file, or is
    that step in Student B's class?
Presumably the file parsing is in the file-parser class (Student B), but then am I getting passed
    a string/two strings or a character?
